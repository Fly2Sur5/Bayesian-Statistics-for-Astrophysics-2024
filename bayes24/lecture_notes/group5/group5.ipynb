    "### Informative priors\n",
    "Informative priors convey information about one or more variables in your statsitical model. Often the posterior of previous experiments/analyses is used as the prior of current future experiments/analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the goal that over time the posterior will be dominated by data, rather then the underlying assumptions made by a weakly informing prior. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, an infomative prior can be setup if substantial existing information is present, improving the estimate and inference about parameter $\\theta_i$, in prior distribution $\\pi\\left(\\theta_i\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weakly informative priors\n",
    "Rather then building upon an informative prior, a weakly informative prior only builds on rought estimates and information known about the aforementioend parimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to take into the account the inherint objectivity that choosin such a prior brings. And during the process of choosing a prior it is important to not constrain the result and prevent extremities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such the construction of a weakly informative prior is as follows (Gelman et al., 2021):\n",
    "* Start with some version of a noninformative prior distribution and then add enough information so that inferences are constrained to be reasonable.\n",
    "* Start with a strong, highly informative prior and broaden it to account for uncertainty in oneâ€™s prior beliefs and in the applicability of any historically based prior distribution to new data.\n",

    "### Improper priors\n",
    "An improper, or rather a non-informative, prior is a prior which cannot be a proper probability density. As for prior probabily density $\\pi\\left(\\theta_i\\right)$ the following can be said:\n",
